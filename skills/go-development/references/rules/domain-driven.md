## Favor Rich Domain Models

**Impact: HIGH**

Internal implementations should be driven by business logic (Domain-Driven Design). Avoid creating "Anemic Domain Models" where structs are mere data containers and logic is scattered across various service layers. Instead, strive for **Rich Domain Models** where entities encapsulate both data and the behaviors that operate on that data.

### Implement Rich Models

Rich models encapsulate their behavior and enforce business rules (invariants) through well-defined methods. This ensures that an entity is always in a valid state.

To facilitate easy data mapping during queries (e.g., when loading from a database), **export important variables by default** (including status). Reserve private fields for internal behavior handlers or complex state logic that shouldn't be exposed or manipulated directly.

**Correct (Rich Domain Model with Behavioral State):**

```go
type Order struct {
    ID     string // Exported for easy mapping/querying
    Items  []Item // Exported for easy mapping/querying
    Status string // Exported for easy mapping/querying

    state orderState // Private interface defining behavioral logic
}

type orderState interface {
    AddItem(o *Order, item Item) error
    Complete(o *Order) error
}

// NewOrder is a factory that ensures valid initial state and behavior
func NewOrder(id string) *Order {
    o := &Order{
        ID:     id,
        Status: "pending",
        Items:  []Item{},
    }
    o.state = &pendingState{} // Initialize with specific behavioral logic
    return o
}

// Complete delegates behavior to the internal state handler
func (o *Order) Complete() error {
    return o.state.Complete(o)
}

// AddItem delegates behavior to the internal state handler
func (o *Order) AddItem(item Item) error {
    return o.state.AddItem(o, item)
}
```

### Best Practices

1.  **Selective Encapsulation**: Export fields that are primarily data containers for easy persistence mapping. Use private fields for sensitive internal state or state that requires complex validation during transitions.
2.  **Ensure Invariants**: Every method on a domain entity should leave the entity in a valid state. If an action would violate a business rule, return a domain error (refer to [Define and Return Domain Errors](error-domain-error.md)).
3.  **Constructors (Factories)**: Use constructor functions (e.g., `NewUser`, `NewOrder`) to ensure that entities are created with all required data and in a valid initial state.
4.  **Behavior Over Data**: When adding a feature, ask: "Which domain object's responsibility is this?" before automatically putting it in a Service.
5.  **Ubiquitous Language**: Use method names that reflect the business language (e.g., `DeactivateUser()` instead of `SetDeleted(true)`).
